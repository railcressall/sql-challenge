Module 9 Challenge

Please find the queries and table schemas in the Employee SQL folder within this repo. 
CSVs can be found in the Starter_Code Folder. 

when completing this assigment I was unaware if I needed to save each individual query as its own .sql file. I have saved it all in one file. Highlighting and running each section of the query code will populate the table requested in order of the assigment instructions. 

If this needs to be saved differenly for proper grading, please let me know. I will work with my instructor or TA to get this saved the proper way so grading can be completed.
